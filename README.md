#####1.  External data source used to populate your Heroku database.

    The external data source that I have used for this project is from the external datasource http://www.data.gov/developers/apis. The sample data file used is a csv file from the College Scoreboard dataset. This csv file contains about 26000 records and therefore it has been tailored to contain 380 records with a primary key (UNITID) and other non-primary keys.

#####2. Heroku toolbelt commands to execute the scripts.

* Github commands to create a github repository and clone it to the desktop.
